# Geometry
* AHDC and ATOF geometry services exist in COATJAVA and export to GEMC.
* Detector materials, target, support geometries should be checked. 

# Digitization 
* Sensitive volumes record GEANT hits, output in GEMC truth bank.
* ADC/TDC banks also output from GEMC.  Not final, pending real data(?).
  * How sophisticated is the GeV/ns -> ADC/TDC model?
* Time-to-distance/DOCA (?) in GEMC in progress, based on Garfield.
